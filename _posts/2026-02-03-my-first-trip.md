Inner Mongolia has long been my winter birding target site, boosting by its unique winter birds and resident owls. Due to many reasons it's not until Jan 2026 can I spare some time and money to do this trip, giving me 6 easy (kind of) lifers that has long been my most wanted northern birds and excess a small monument in my China life list of over 1150.

All the birding trips covering this area need to contact a local guide Mr. Zhang, who's long been a sharp local hunter.
